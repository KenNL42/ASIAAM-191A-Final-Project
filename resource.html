    <h3>Mental Health Resources</h3>
    <p>
        Institutions of higher education can have a profound effect on many students’ mental health. This is especially true for students with identities outside what is considered “normative” in a university setting. This can be first-generation or low-income students, students of color, LGBTQ+ students, etc. Despite the challenges you may face at university, your existence is an example of resiliency. Here are some resources to better help you explore and strengthen your own mental health.</p>
