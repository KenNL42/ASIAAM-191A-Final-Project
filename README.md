## Objective
We seek to provide details of the UCLA campus entailing the resources the campus has while pinpointing which resources are most often referred to from fellow students who share the same backgrounds or mental health issues. From that, we also want to ensure the idea that the campus provides resources that are able to hit the marks of cultural competency, language awareness, as well as assure people about going to these resources. We want to listen to studentsâ€™ responses, and distribute them to our website. 

Alongside that, this is just a place for each student to see how some of their fellow Bruins are doing along any area of the spectrum. Although anonymous, seeing the different stories amongst one another could shed some light on everyone's current mood while possibly relating with each other. 

In the meantime, we sought to reflect and show some light on these questions below with our project: 

* How does the accessibility of mental health resources affect community use/awareness?
* Do all demographics of students find mental health resources to be the same level of accessibility? 

## Who is being empowered
Our application was made for current UCLA students. We hope to empower the UCLA community in two ways. First, we want to empower students to add their voice to the collective by giving them an opportuninty to tell their own mental health story. We designed the survey to avoid leading questions, and have allowed for the flexible answers (students can disclose as little or as much as they'd like).
Second, we want to empower those using the site to seek resources, if needed. There are many obstacles impeding students from accessing mental health resources. Some of this is simple awareness, but there are also real barriers to acessing resources such as affordability, cultural competency of the resource, etc. To hopefully increase transparency, we have created filters for what each campus resource offers.

## What technology was used
We use Leaflet to generate the map and markers. We also use HTML/CSS and javascript to process user data.

We use HTML/CSS and javascript to build the website and process user data. [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is used to create the map and markers of users and resource location. We also use [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display statistics of user stories and locations. 

We provide JSON file of user data to be transparent and open-source. Users are welcome to use our data: https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/1RFDPVCED6oKJYgqE04U2lJbO4oSF_ECeC3GcbaKvoZg/o5hgy6r/public/values?alt=json
